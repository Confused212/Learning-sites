                        Invisalign Go
                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        Clear aligner therapy or Invisalign Go as it is more commonly known, is a system that uses clear flexible trays that clip onto the tooth arch with strategically placed composite attachments. Within five months this gentle, almost invisible treatment will
                        help correct minor misalignment issues. It does not only result in a more balanced smile, but may help correct rotations in teeth that would otherwise limit the aesthetic result of planned restorative work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        Please ring the number in the photo and speak to one of our friendly receptionists who will arrange a consultation for you. During this consultation the treatment process will be explained in detail and you will be able to ask Dr Davies all your questions.
                        Photos of your teeth and face will be taken and uploaded to the Invisalign site for analysis. Within five minutes the result will be sent to Dr Davies, who will explain how your case will be managed. You will be given an information
                        leaflet and a consent form to review and a cooling off period for a week. Dr Davies will then call you to discuss your decision and if you have decided to go ahead, she will hand you to the reception team to continue planning the
                        treatment pathway. If you are seen by one of the other Dentists at the practice who don't provide Invisalign, rest assured that all the necessary information is relayed back to Dr Davies and she will be in touch with you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        At the next appointment, a full exam and x-rays will be done to rule out an dental issues before iGo can commence. <br> You will be asked to sign some consent forms and the risks will be explained to you. Upper and Lower silicone
                        impressions will be taken and sent to Invisalign so that a computerised treatment plan may be sent to Dr Davies for your approval. Please note that a non-refundable deposit of £150 is taken at the end of this appointment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        Within a week, you will be asked to come in to view your personalised Clincheck. If you are happy with the final result, Dr Davies will approve the treatment plan and Invisalign will start making your custom clear aligners. Please note that a non-refundable
                        lab fee of £850 is taken at the end of this appointment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        At your fourth appointment, which is usually within 10 days of the treatment plan approval, you will have IPR (interproximal stripping) if required, composite attachments placed (if necessary) and your first tray fitted. You will be given an appointment
                        schedule and your aligners. You will change your aligners approximately every 7-10 days as recommended by Dr Davies. You will also receive a complementary Waterpik Water Flosser (as per the Dream Smile package mentioned above).
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        Mid way into your aligner therapy, you will be given 6 whitening syringes and shown how to effectively use them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        The week you are due to start wearing your final aligner you will have new impressions made and sent off for your Vivera retainers, so that at your final appointment with Dr Davies, she can remove your attachments and then you will only need to wear the
                        retainers at night, to prevent further tooth movement.

                        Water Flossing
                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        For many of my patients, flossing is chore. I've looked into different methods to try to motivate people (myself included!), however I couldn't find anything that was flexible enough for everyone's individual needs. When floss or interdental brushes run
                        out, they are usually forgotten about or become a hassle or an expense to restock.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        As for this glowing discovery, the credit goes to my husband, Mr Davies! As a technology enthusiast, he is always scouting out new electronics to improve our life. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        He had to convince me to spend the money, as initially I'll admit I thought this was a gimmick. However from the first time I used it, I was hooked. I should mention now that I do not work for Waterpik, or any company with regards to advertising products.
                        But I do trial products I think may work for my patients before recommending them. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        I chose Waterpik because they are a well known brand and have had independant clinical studies done on their products. Since using this particular model (WP-660 Ultra Professional Water Flosser), I have also organised a Lunch & Learn with the local rep
                        to learn more about its uses. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        Whether you have implants, Invisalign Go, Dentures, Periodontal pockets or plain old healthy gums, you will surprised what is hiding in between your teeth! The water jets in between your teeth at gum level, forcing any bacteria, food or soft plaque into
                        your mouth, so you can spit it into the sink. I was shocked that even after flossing, I still had food particles coming out when using the Water Flosser. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        There are two modes and 5 pressure gages to choose from. I use the floss mode on pressure 10 (the highest) with luke warm water in the reservoir (I sometimes add some mouthwash to the mixture). A full reservoir can hold 90 seconds of flossing water but
                        I have never needed that much. The jet is surprisingly powerful, but very comfortable and it leaves you feeling satisfyingly clean.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph popup__text--1">
                        The best part is that it comes as a portable model as well so if you travel a lot there is no excuse not to take it with you!
                    </p>
