                    For the past 17 years, I have been working with in the engineering world, mainly on aircraft for both the UK Airforce and the Saudi Arabia Airforce, this is where I gain my interest in problem solving, along with the ability to preform tasks to a strict
                    time line, and under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have takin this desire to learn and problem solve and turned it towards a career in web development, where I find the process both extremly rewarding and frustrating at the same time, but the challenge everyday keeps me going.
