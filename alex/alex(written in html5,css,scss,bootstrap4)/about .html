                        Born to Welsh parents, Alexandra and her family moved to Cyprus when she was twelve years old. She attended a local secondary school, learning through the medium of Modern Greek and finished her last year with a leaving Certificate of over 95%. As a teenager
                        her perseverance and conscientiousness helped her achieve everything she set her mind to, particularly in sport; she excelled in Swimming and went on to win some National Events. The decision to study dentistry in Eastern Europe
                        in 2007, exposed her to yet more cultures, personal growth opportunities and travel.

                        Alexandra has committed to and is currently studying a part-time MSc at the University of Manchester in Aesthetic and Restorative Dentistry, receiving distinction in her assessments. When she returned to her associate position in April of 2018, she continued
                        to collect cases and document them; Alexandra then decided to broaden her skill set further, by completing Invisalign Go training and started her qualifications in Facial Aesthetics. In 2019, Alexandra’s extensive training portfolio
                        also gained three further Facial Aesthetic Qualifications: Mid-facial Fillers, SuneKos and BioRePeel.

                        Alexandra obtained her DMD (Doctor of Medical Dentistry), from the University of Pécs, Hungary in 2013. That Winter, she returned to her roots, where she spent the next four years working in several mixed NHS and Private practices in South Wales. In order
                        to develop her new skill set, Alexandra enrolled in the prestigious Tipton Training postgraduate courses. In early 2017 she completed The Restorative Course, and before that The Phantom Head Course, which helped her excel in the
                        restoration of more complex treatment cases. In order to help nervous patients, or those requiring a more holistic approach, Alexandra also studied Dental Acupuncture.

                            Alexandra’s passion for Dentistry has driven her to focus upon specific goals with her patients’ satisfaction as the highest priority. Her main concern is her patients’ journey whilst under her care. “Informed consent is the first and most important thing
                            before a smile makeover truly begins. A patient must be made aware of their choices and be able to make a decision based on the knowledge of how each decision will affect them. This first step leads me as clinician to a point
                            where I can truly empower my patients as they will feel included and invested in their treatment process,” says Alexandra. “When patients understand the clinical pathway and are actively making decisions, I am then able to
                            create tailor-made treatments. Once my work as a Dentist is done on a practical level, I still have a duty of care towards those for whom I have created a new smile. Educating a patient about maintenance and the impacts of
                            certain lifestyles is the key to long term results."
