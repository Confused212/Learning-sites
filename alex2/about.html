                            Born to Welsh parents, Alexandra and her family moved to Cyprus when she was twelve years old. She attended a local secondary school, learning through the medium of Modern Greek and finished her last year with a leaving Certificate of over 95%. As a teenager
                            her perseverance and conscientiousness helped her achieve everything she set her mind to, particularly in sport; she excelled in Swimming and went on to win some National Events. The decision to study dentistry in Eastern Europe
                            in 2007, exposed her to yet more cultures, personal growth opportunities and travel.

                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph about__para"> During the second quarter of 2017, Alexandra got married and relocated to Buckinghamshire where she continued to treat patients until her son was born in January 2018. Despite the challenges of balancing work and family commitments,
                            Alexandra continues to enjoy her professional development.

                        <p class="paragraph about__para">The end of 2018 saw the Davies family relocate to Oxfordshire. Alexandra now works in a mixed practice in Abingdon and continues to develop her aesthetic and restorative portfolio.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph bout__para">
                        Alexandra obtained her DMD (Doctor of Medical Dentistry), from the University of Pécs, Hungary in 2013. That Winter, she returned to her roots, where she spent the next four years working in several mixed NHS and Private practices in South Wales. In order
                        to develop her new skill set, Alexandra enrolled in the prestigious Tipton Training postgraduate courses. In early 2017 she completed The Restorative Course, and before that The Phantom Head Course, which helped her excel in the
                        restoration of more complex treatment cases. In order to help nervous patients, or those requiring a more holistic approach, Alexandra also studied Dental Acupuncture. ​
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph "> Alexandra has committed to and is currently studying a part-time MSc at the University of Manchester in Aesthetic and Restorative Dentistry, receiving distinction in her assessments. When she returned to her associate position in April
                        this year, she continued to collect cases and document them; Alexandra then decided to broaden her skill set further, by completing Invisalign Go training and starting her qualifications in Facial Aesthetics. ​
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph "> In August 2018, Alexandra launched her own website and was featured as a UK winner in the CEOToday Healthcare Awards issue of CEOToday Magazine. Following this publication, three other accolades were awarded: 1. Most Influential Woman
                        in Facial Rejuvenation Treatments in Buckinghamshire, by Acquisition International: 2018 Influential Business Woman Awards. 2. UK Winner: Gamechanger of the Year and 3. Uk Winner: Aesthetic & Restorative Dentistry Practice of the
                        Year, both by ACQ5 Gamechanger Awards 2018: Healthcare/Pharmaceutical/Biotech & Medtech.
